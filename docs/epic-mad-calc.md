# Epic: CLI Calculator for Primary School Students (mad calc)

## Epic Goal

Deliver a simple, child-friendly command-line calculator that enables primary school students (ages 6-12) to perform basic arithmetic operations, including support for parentheses, in a safe and accessible way.

## Value Proposition

- Empowers young learners to practice and improve math skills independently
- Provides teachers with a reliable, distraction-free digital tool for classroom use
- Fills the gap between complex calculators and educational needs for early math education
- Gently introduces students to the command line, fostering early technical literacy

## Key Deliverables

- CLI calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses
- Additional functions: square root, power of two, and cube
- Minimal, child-friendly interface with clear prompts and error messages
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- No data collection; safe for children

## Acceptance Criteria

- Students can solve basic math problems, including those with parentheses, without adult assistance
- Teachers can recommend and use the tool in classroom settings
- Calculator runs instantly and works on all major operating systems

## Out of Scope

- Advanced mathematical functions beyond the specified scope (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms)
- Graphical user interface
- Data storage or analytics

## Success Metrics

- Adoption in at least one classroom
- Positive feedback from students and teachers
- No critical bugs reported during classroom use

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Adoption Risk:** Provide clear instructions and error messages to reduce CLI intimidation
- **Technical Risk:** Test across all target OSes to ensure compatibility
