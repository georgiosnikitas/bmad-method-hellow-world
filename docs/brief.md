Project Brief: mad calc
======================


Executive Summary
-----------------

mad calc is a CLI calculator designed for primary school students. The project aims to provide a simple, accessible tool for basic arithmetic operations, supporting early math education. The key value proposition is an easy-to-use, distraction-free calculator tailored for young learners.


Problem Statement
-----------------

Primary school students often lack access to simple, age-appropriate digital calculators. Existing solutions are either too complex, filled with unnecessary features, or not designed for educational use. This gap can hinder math learning and confidence at an early age. There is an urgent need for a focused, child-friendly calculator tool.


Proposed Solution
-----------------

Develop a command-line calculator application using Java, optimized for primary school students. The solution will focus on simplicity, clarity, and educational value. A key reason for the CLI approach is to gently introduce students to the command line, helping them become familiar with a fundamental tool in the tech world. This differentiates the project from generic calculators by adding a layer of technical literacy to its educational value.


Target Users
------------


### Primary User Segment: Primary School Students

- Demographic: Children aged 6-12
- Behaviors: Learning basic math, using computers in school/home
- Needs: Simple, safe, and reliable calculator
- Goals: Improve math skills, complete homework, build confidence


Goals & Success Metrics
----------------------


### Business Objectives

- Deliver a working CLI calculator in 10 days
- Achieve adoption in at least one classroom or educational setting


### User Success Metrics

- Number of students using the calculator
- User satisfaction (teacher/student feedback)


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Completion within 10 days
- No critical bugs reported in classroom use


MVP Scope
---------


### Core Features (Must Have)

- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) supporting parentheses: Simple commands for each operation
- Square root, power of two, and cube functions
- Clear, child-friendly CLI interface: Minimal text, easy prompts


### Out of Scope for MVP

- Graphical user interface


### MVP Success Criteria

MVP is successful if a primary school student can use the calculator independently to solve basic math problems, and a teacher can recommend it for classroom use.


Post-MVP Vision
---------------


### Phase 2 Features

- Add support for fractions and decimals
- Include simple math games or quizzes


### Long-term Vision

Expand to support more advanced math, multi-language support, and integration with educational platforms.


### Expansion Opportunities

- Mobile or web version
- Partnerships with educational content providers


Technical Considerations
------------------------


### Platform Requirements

- Target Platforms: macOS, Windows, Linux (CLI)
- Browser/OS Support: Not applicable (CLI only)
- Performance Requirements: Fast startup, instant response


### Technology Preferences

- Frontend: Not applicable
- Backend: Java
- Database: None
- Hosting/Infrastructure: Local execution


### Architecture Considerations

- Repository Structure: Single Java project
- Service Architecture: Monolithic CLI app
- Integration Requirements: None for MVP
- Security/Compliance: Safe for children, no data collection


Constraints & Assumptions
-------------------------


### Constraints

- Budget: Not specified
- Timeline: 10 days
- Resources: Java developer(s)
- Technical: Must use Java, CLI only


### Key Assumptions

- Students have access to a computer with Java installed
- Teachers are willing to introduce CLI tools in class


Risks & Open Questions
----------------------


### Key Risks

- **Adoption Risk:** Students/teachers may find CLI intimidating
- **Technical Risk:** Compatibility issues across OSes


### Open Questions

- How will feedback from students/teachers be collected?
- Are there accessibility needs to consider?


### Areas Needing Further Research

- Best practices for designing CLI tools for children
- Review of similar educational tools
